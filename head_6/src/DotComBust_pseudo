DECLARE and instantiate the GameHelper instance variable named helper.
DECLARE and instantiate an ArrayList to hold the list of DotComs (initially three) Call it dotComsList.
DECLARE and int variable to hold the number of user guesses (so that we can give the user a score at the end of the game)
.Name it numOfGuesses and set it to 0.

DECLARE a setUpGame() method to create and initialize the DotCom objects with names and locations.
        Display brief instructions to the users.
DECLARE a startPlaying() method that asks the player for guesses and calls the checkUserGuess() method until all the
        DotCom objects are removed from play.
DECLARE a checkUserGuess() method that loops through all remaining DotCom objects and calls each DotCom object's
        checkYourself() method.
DECLARE a finishGame() method that prints a message about the user's performance, based on how many guess it took to
        sink all of the DotCom objects.

METHOD:void setUpGame()
    //make three DotCom objects and name them
    CREATE three DotCom objects.
    SET  a name for each DotCom.
    ADD the DotComs to the dotComsList(the ArrayList).
    REPEAT with each of the DotCom objects in the dotComsList array
        CALL the placeDotCom() method on the helper object to get a randomly-selected location for this DotCom (three
        cells, vertically or horizontally aligned,on a 7*7 grid).
        SET the location for each DotCom based on the result of the placeDotCom() call.
    END REPEAT
END METHOD

METHOD:void startPlaying()
    REPEAT while any DotComs exist
        GET user input by calling the helper getUserInput() method
        EVALUATE the user's guess by checkUserGuess() method
    END REPEAT
END METHOD

METHOD:void checkUserGuess(String userGuess)
    //find out if there's a hit (and kill) on any DotCom
    INCREMENT the number of user guesses in the numOfGuesses variable
    SET the local result variable (a String) to "miss",assuming that the user's guess will be a miss.
    REPEAT with each of the DotObjects in the dotComList array
        EVALUATE the user's guess by calling the DotCom object's checkYourself() method
        SET the result variable to "hit" or "kill" if appropriate
        IF the result is "kill", REMOVE the DotCom from the dotComsList
    END REPEAT
    DISPLAY the result value to the user
END METHOD

METHOD:void finishGame()
    DISPLAY a generic "game over" message,then:
